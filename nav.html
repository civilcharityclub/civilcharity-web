				The Civil and Charity Club was established in 2022 at Faraja Orphanage Center in Arusha, Tanzania. It was founded as a college club by the Civil Engineering Department of Arusha Technical College.

				The club was driven by CITSO, which stands for "Civil Engineering Technical Students Organization." CITSO is a student-led organization that aims to provide support, guidance, and resources to students pursuing a degree in civil engineering.
				
				The club's founders recognized the importance of giving back to the community and decided to start a charity club that would focus on supporting local causes. They chose Faraja Orphanage Center as the site of their first project.
				
				Since its founding, the Civil and Charity Club has grown in size and scope. It has expanded its reach to other parts of Tanzania and has taken on a variety of projects, including community outreach programs, fundraising initiatives, and volunteer efforts.
				
				The club's mission remains the same: to show love, care, and hospitality to those in need. The Civil and Charity Club is dedicated to making a positive impact in the lives of people in Tanzania and beyond

				The number eight can also represent the idea of balance and harmony.
				balance and harmony are important because they reflect the idea of giving back to society in a way that benefits everyone. By balancing our own needs and desires with the needs of others, we can create a harmonious and balanced world.
			</p>
			<p>
				the diamond shape can represent the idea of transformation and growth. Diamonds start out as rough and unpolished stones, but with the right tools and care, they can be transformed into beautiful gems. Similarly, people in need can experience transformation and growth through the support and assistance provided by care-takers.
			</p>
			<p>
				The square shape can also represent a sense of security and protection, which are key elements of caring for others. People who are in need of help often feel vulnerable, and care-takers must provide a safe and secure environment where they can feel supported and protected.

Additionally, the square shape can represent organization and structure, which are essential elements of effective care-giving. Care-takers must be well-organized and structured in their approach to providing support and assistance to those in need.
